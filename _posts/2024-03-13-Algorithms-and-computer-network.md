# Computer Networks 

Why CN ?
 File/ Application Sharing
 Hardware Sharing
 Client-Server model
 Voice over IP (VoIP)
 Storage

 A set of devices(or nodes) connected by media link is called Network.
 A node can be a device which can send or recieve data generated by other nodes on the network like printer etc :

 is client server model differnet from this internode communication
 The links connecting the devices are called communicating channels </br>



>Transmission mode
>> Simplex </br>
>> Half Duplex </br>
>> Full Duplex </br>

### Transmission media 
> Guided Media
>> Coaxial </br>
>>> Baseband </br>
>>> Broadband </br>

fibre Optics 
>> Twisted </br>
>>> Unshielded </br>
>>> Shielded
