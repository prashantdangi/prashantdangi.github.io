## Introduction to API Testing

Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) have become the backbone of modern applications, making API security testing crucial for organizations. This post explores key concepts in API security testing and common vulnerabilities.

## Core API Testing Concepts

- **Authentication Testing**: Verifying how the API handles user identity
- **Authorization Testing**: Checking access control mechanisms
- **Data Validation**: Testing input handling and validation
- **Error Handling**: Examining how the API responds to errors
- **Performance Testing**: Evaluating response times and load handling

## Common API Security Vulnerabilities

### 1. Business Logic Flaws
Business logic flaws occur when attackers manipulate legitimate API workflows:
- Parameter manipulation
- State manipulation
- Process timing exploitation

### 2. Authorization Issues
Authorization vulnerabilities remain a critical concern:
- Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)
  - Lateral movement attacks
  - Privilege escalation attempts
- Missing access controls
- Insufficient authorization checks

### 3. Input Validation Weaknesses
- Improper handling of unexpected input
- Lack of proper input sanitization
- Missing type checking
- Insufficient length validation

### 4. Best Practices for API Security
- Implement strong authentication mechanisms
- Use proper authorization controls
- Validate all input
- Monitor API usage patterns
- Regular security testing
- Keep documentation updated

## Tools for API Testing
- Postman
- Burp Suite
- OWASP ZAP
- JMeter
- SoapUI

## Conclusion
API security testing requires a methodical approach and understanding of both security principles and API architecture. Regular testing and following security best practices are essential for maintaining secure APIs.
