# NVIDIA Inference Microservices(NIM)

There are 170+ of models by NVIDIA. You can find them here: [NVIDIA Models](https://build.nvidia.com/models) 

## Key Features of NVIDIA Inference Microservices

1. **Production-Ready Deployment**
   - Pre-configured containers with optimized runtime environments
   - Automated scaling and load balancing
   - Built-in monitoring and logging capabilities
   - Enterprise-grade security features

2. **Hardware Optimization**
   - Specifically tuned for NVIDIA GPUs
   - Supports multiple GPU architectures (Ampere, Hopper, Ada Lovelace)
   - Efficient resource utilization
   - Dynamic batch processing

This blog explains using two NIM models by Nvidia:

* meta/llama3-70b-instruct, and

* nvidia/nv-embedqa-e5-v5

## meta/llama3-70b-instruct

![llama3-70b-instruct](/assets/images/llama3-70b-instruct.png)

This model is a large language model developed by Meta. The model is designed to be a general-purpose language model that can be used for a wide range of natural language processing tasks, including language translation, text generation, and question answering.

The model is available on the Hugging Face platform and can be used with the Hugging Face Transformers library. It is also available on the NVIDIA Inference Microservices platform, which provides a cloud-based infrastructure for running inference on NVIDIA GPUs.

### Ways to use this model(using the NIM):

* Hosted API: Using NVIDIA Inference Microservices(NIM) with Nvidia's infrastructure access the model. (But in this you can only use 1000 api calls per month)

* Self-hosted API: Using NVIDIA Inference Microservices(NIM) with your own infrastructure access the model. And in this case you can use infinite api calls to use the model.

## nvidia/nv-embedqa-e5-v5 

![nv-embedqa-e5-v5](/assets/images/nv-embedqa-e5-v5.png)

The NVIDIA Retrieval QA E5 Embedding Model is an embedding model optimized for text question-answering retrieval.

### Ways to use this model(using the NIM):

**Same as previous model.**
