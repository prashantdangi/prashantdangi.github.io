# Demo 1

Welcome to my first demo post! In this article, I'll walk you through a simple example of how to work with integers in different programming languages.

## Basic Integer Operations

Let's look at some basic integer operations:

## Integer Limits

Different programming languages have different integer limits. For example:

- In Python 3, integers have unlimited precision
- In Java, an `int` typically ranges from -2³¹ to 2³¹-1
- In C++, an `int` is usually 32 bits, but this can vary by platform

## Common Integer Problems

1. Integer Overflow
2. Division by Zero
3. Rounding errors with integer division

Remember to always consider these factors when working with integers in your programs!

## Conclusion

Understanding how to work with integers is fundamental to programming. In future demos, we'll explore more complex topics building on these basics.
